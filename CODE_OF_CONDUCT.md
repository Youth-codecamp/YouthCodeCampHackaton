# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Youth Code Camp Hackathon! We want everyone to feel safe and respected here. So, we have some rules for how we should all behave:

1. **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and empathy. Harassment and discrimination of any form will not be tolerated.

2. **Collaborate:** Work together in a positive and constructive manner. Embrace diversity of thought and background.

3. **Maintain a Safe Environment:** Help us create a safe space by reporting any inappropriate behavior to the organizers immediately.

4. **Follow the Rules:** Adhere to the event rules and guidelines provided by the organizers. Failure to comply may result in removal from the event.

5. **Respect Privacy:** Respect the privacy and personal boundaries of others. Do not share personal information without consent.

6. **Use Appropriate Language:** Use respectful and inclusive language in all communications and interactions.

7. **Be Responsible:** Take responsibility for your actions and their impact on others. Be accountable for your behavior.

8. **Have Fun:** While we're here to learn and innovate, let's also enjoy the experience and have fun together!

If you have any questions, concerns, or experience any issues related to the code of conduct, please reach out to the organizers. Thank you for helping us create a positive and welcoming environment for all participants.
