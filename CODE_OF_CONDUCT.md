## 1. Inclusivity and Respect

- Treat everyone nicely, no matter who they are or where they come from.
- We should all get along and help each other out.

## 2. Collaboration and Cooperation

- Let's all work together and share our ideas.
- Encourage sharing of knowledge and resources to help each other succeed.

## 3. Act Like a Pro

- Behave well, both online and offline.
- Don't do anything that could upset or scare anyone.

## 4. Look After Stuff

- Respect the place where we're meeting and any equipment we're using.
- Don't damage anything or make a mess.

## 5. Follow the Rules

- Stick to the rules and laws.
- Don't use things that belong to someone else without permission.

## 6. Tell Someone if Something's Wrong

- If something bad happens or someone's not acting right, tell one of the organizers.
- We'll keep it private and sort it out.

## 7. What Happens if You Break the Rules

- If you don't follow these rules, you might have to leave the event.
- If you do something really bad, you might not be allowed to come back.
